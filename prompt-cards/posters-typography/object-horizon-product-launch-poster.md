# Object Horizon Product Launch Poster

## Use this when

Use this card when you need to build a fictional launch poster around one authorized product reference. Use a Recipe when exact typography, preservation, structured repair, repeatability, or evidence matters.

## Required inputs

- A fictional or authorized subject brief and intended audience.
- The exact approved copy manifest, including an explicit `none` when no text is allowed.
- Visual motif, palette, type direction, composition rules, output size, and channel crop.
- One attached reference image and confirmation that it is authorized for this use.
- A preservation manifest separating protected features from approved changes.

## Prompt

```text
COMMISSION
Create one 4:5 product launch poster to build a fictional launch poster around one authorized product reference. Use this independently authored concept: the preserved product silhouette meets a single horizon of colored light.

REFERENCE INPUT
Use the attached authorized {REFERENCE_IMAGE} only for {REFERENCE_ROLE}. Preserve {PRESERVE_RULES}; change only elements explicitly permitted by the brief. Do not infer unseen geometry, replace an identity, alter protected copy, or import marks from the reference.

CONTENT
Build the subject from {SUBJECT_BRIEF}. Render only the exact approved copy in {COPY_MANIFEST}; if the manifest says `none`, render no text. Do not add names, dates, sponsors, claims, labels, or calls to action outside that manifest.

VISUAL SYSTEM
Use {VISUAL_MOTIF}, {PALETTE}, and {TYPE_DIRECTION}. Organize the page as follows: product centered low with exact launch copy floating in open space. Apply {COMPOSITION_RULES} for hierarchy, margins, crop, contrast, and reading order.

CONSTRAINTS
Use only fictional, public-domain, or authorized subject matter. No real brand, copied campaign, celebrity likeness, unsupported claim, unapproved logo, pseudo-writing, signature, or watermark.

OUTPUT INTENT
Return one flat product launch poster at {OUTPUT_SIZE} in 4:5. Do not place it in a wall, frame, device, or merchandise mockup.
```

## Variables

- `{SUBJECT_BRIEF}`: fictional or authorized subject, audience, purpose, and factual details
- `{COPY_MANIFEST}`: complete allowed text with exact spelling and hierarchy, or `none`
- `{VISUAL_MOTIF}`: one original central motif and its visual role
- `{PALETTE}`: approved color names or values and contrast relationship
- `{TYPE_DIRECTION}`: project-owned typography character, weight, and case direction
- `{COMPOSITION_RULES}`: margins, reading order, focal position, safe zones, and crop behavior
- `{OUTPUT_SIZE}`: final pixel dimensions
- `{REFERENCE_IMAGE}`: attached authorized single reference image
- `{REFERENCE_ROLE}`: the sole role the reference may play in the composition
- `{PRESERVE_RULES}`: features, geometry, identity, copy, or relationships that must remain unchanged

## Negative constraints

- No copied poster, campaign system, trademark, copyrighted character, celebrity likeness, or unlicensed artwork.
- No misspelled, paraphrased, duplicated, invented, clipped, or decorative pseudo-text.
- No unsupported factual or product claim, signature, watermark, mockup scene, or extra design option.

## Quick check

Confirm the result reads as one product launch poster, verify the exact copy against the manifest, and check the intended arrangement at thumbnail size: product centered low with exact launch copy floating in open space. This is only an obvious-failure check.

## Placeholder Preview

Sample status: Placeholder Preview. No recorded generation run.

Expected result: the preserved product silhouette meets a single horizon of colored light. Layout: product centered low with exact launch copy floating in open space. This intended appearance is untested and has no Card-level evidence.

## Rights and provenance

This Prompt Card is independently authored with `original` source posture. Use only fictional, public-domain, or properly authorized text, subjects, images, and type direction. The attached reference image must be owned or explicitly authorized, and its preservation manifest must be honored.
